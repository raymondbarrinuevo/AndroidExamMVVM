# AndroidExamMVVM

Persistence:

Check data count in local and data count from server.
if same app will get from local else from data will be save in local then passed by the view.

Assuming data will not change any of its property.
for me to demonstrate fetching data from local using the same view


Architecture:

MVVM this is my choice to learn more about it even if I am use to in using MVP

UI and design:

LinearLayout - the reason why I use because its easier to read
Relativelayout - if only view will overlapping. for instance when I use ProgressBar in MainActivity
